# SD2E Jupyter Notebook Environment

This repository builds the Docker image supporting the SD2E Jupyter Notebooks environment. Until the platform team releases the upcoming feature to select beteween support environments at launch time, major dependencies and configuration options must be set in this base image. 

Via a combination of the repository itself plus GitHub's collaborative issue management, code review, and other features we are implementing a cooperative process for SD2 collaborators to improve and extend the runtime environment. When we transition to supporting multiple base images, we'll extend this process to support that feature.

## Guidelines and policies

The process for community contributions is outlined in [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Critical guidelines for the maintainers of this repo and the SD2E Jupyter are in [MAINTAINERS](./MAINTAINERS.md).
